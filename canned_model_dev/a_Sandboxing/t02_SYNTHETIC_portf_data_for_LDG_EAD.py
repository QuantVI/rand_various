--------
## LGD (Loss Given Default)

LGD is:

    $$
    LGD = \frac{\text{EAD – Recovery}}{\text{EAD}}
    $$

Columns to use should describe **recoveries vs. what was owed**:

* **`out_prncp` / `out_prncp_inv`** → Outstanding principal at the time of default.
* **`total_rec_prncp`** → Total principal received.
* **`total_rec_int`** → Total interest received.
* **`total_rec_late_fee`** → Total late fees received.
* **`recoveries`** → Amount recovered post-default (collection).
* **`collection_recovery_fee`** → Fees deducted from recoveries.
* **`loan_amnt`** (or `funded_amnt`) → Original exposure, needed for scaling.
* **`loan_status`** → Indicator of whether default/charged-off (used to identify LGD cases).


**Characteristics:**

* LGD columns are typically **monetary** (dollar amounts).
* For defaults, LGD often lies between **0.2 and 0.9** depending on recoveries.
* Recoveries tend to be **skewed right** (most loans recover little, a few recover a lot).


--------
## EAD (Exposure at Default)

EAD is:

    $$
    EAD = \text{Exposure value at the time of default}
    $$

For installment loans, this means **the remaining balance when default occurs**:

* **`out_prncp`** → Directly used as EAD if default occurs.
* **`funded_amnt`** / **`loan_amnt`** → Original notional, for scaling.
* **`revol_bal`** (if revolving loans) → Current revolving balance.
* **`revol_util`** → Utilization percentage, sometimes used in proxy EAD models.
* **`total_pymnt` / `total_pymnt_inv`** → Useful for tracking how much was paid before default.

**Characteristics:**

* For amortizing loans, EAD **declines over time** as installments are paid.
* For revolving loans, EAD **depends on utilization**.
* Usually modeled as a fraction of original exposure, e.g. `EAD = CCF * Exposure` (where CCF = credit conversion factor).

| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| LGD      | `out_prncp`, `total_rec_prncp`, `total_rec_int`, `total_rec_late_fee`, `recoveries`, `collection_recovery_fee`, `loan_status` | Needed to compute cash flows vs. exposure | Skewed, recoveries usually low                      |
| EAD      | `out_prncp`, `funded_amnt`, `loan_amnt`, `revol_bal`, `revol_util`, `total_pymnt`, `total_pymnt_inv`                          | Balance outstanding at default            | Declining (installments) or usage-based (revolving) |

---

In practice, for **synthetic generation**:

* **LGD**:  you’d simulate recoveries as a fraction of exposure
            (Beta distribution is common).
* **EAD**:  you’d simulate balance as a function of time-to-default
            and loan type.

---

Do you want me to sketch a **dummy generator** that:

* Creates EAD as a declining balance process,
* Creates LGD as (1 – recovery\_rate) with recovery\_rate sampled from
    a Beta distribution?
