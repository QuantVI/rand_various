## For Quantitative Risk Management
###### (Investment Banking, Asset/Wealth Management Industry)

#### 'Canned' : Something that is contained, or 'well-captured', often in a generalized fashion

#### 'Model Development' - a multi-stage process that can be generalized  in 3 parts
- Model Research
- Model Implementation
- Model Maintenance

A project focused on the _canned_ design of quantitative risk models

- ignoring research
- not about the specifics of a particular model
- focused on implementation post-protype but pre-production

The project delivers a _toy_ model, designed with the sophistication that one would see within banking institutions, outside of production environments. odels of this type are widely used, and as such no less important to be familiar with than their scalable, load-balanced, optimized, production environemnt counterparts.

Most importantly a canned model is a full-working models without the extras that allows a Quant Analyst to step out of model theory, and away from pure equations, into an implementation with just the right amount of sophistication. It goes well beyond a Black Scholes option price coded in R or VBA, but not so far that there is any concern about platforms and deployments.
