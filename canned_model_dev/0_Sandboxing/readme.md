# Ad-hoc building
This ad-hoc build was for getting pseudocode and some real code written down after the write-up and brainstorming of the model pieces. It especially focused/focuses on making a separate `.py` file for each portion/component/key task witin the model.

The next stage of prototyping is to consider places where, instead of having a separate Python file - that we intend to `import` as a module, use a a Python __object__ instead. We can then import the file an use the __Class__ or _pass_ the object around with the information ("state") we need in multiple places.
