    "Derivatives and Structured products tend to have interestig names such as Bermuda, Altiplano. In fact, so called \"mountain range\" options, are types of structured products/exotic options, desgined by Société Générale in the 1990s. The name of this option was chosen just to be amusing. It's features were then selected to have some relation to the name. I am also a fan of French Vanilla ice cream."
